`API docs
===========

* These are the apis that are *not* self documented in swagger.

##### For login

###### As admin user
`curl -u rest_api_client_normal_user:top_secret -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth/token -H "Accept:application/json" -d "username=umang&password=umang&grant_type=password"`

###### As normal user
`curl -u rest_api_client_normal_user:top_secret -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth/token -H "Accept:application/json" -d "username=normal1&password=aaaaaaaaa&grant_type=password"`


* These apis are documented in swagger too. 
* Listing here sample curls as right now not able to send request as no place to give access token. [ ] Solved
* Everywhere we need to replace "XXX-token-XXX" with token received.
